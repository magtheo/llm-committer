**LLM-Committer** is a Visual Studio Code extension designed to help you write clear, conventional, and contextual Git commit messages with the power of Large Language Models (LLMs).

Streamline your commit workflow by automatically generating insightful commit messages based on your staged changes. Supports multiple LLM providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and OpenRouter.

## Features

*   **AI-Powered Commit Messages:** Generates commit messages by analyzing file diffs.
*   **Multiple LLM Provider Support:**
    *   OpenAI (GPT models)
    *   Anthropic (Claude models)
    *   Google (Gemini models)
    *   OpenRouter (Access a variety of models)
*   **Contextual Understanding:**
    *   **General Context:** Provide project-wide or feature-specific context that applies to all generated messages within the workspace.
    *   **Group-Specific Context:** Add context for a specific group of changes before generating a message.
*   **Flexible Workflow:**
    *   **Group Changes:** Select specific changed files to form a logical commit group.
    *   **Generate or Write Manually:** Get an AI-generated suggestion or write your own message.
    *   **Edit and Refine:** Easily edit generated messages. Regenerate if needed.
    *   **Stage & Commit:** Stage files and commit your groups directly from the extension.
*   **Customizable LLM Behavior:**
    *   Configure model, max tokens, and temperature.
    *   Provide custom instructions to tailor the LLM's output style (e.g., conventional commits, specific tone).
*   **Integrated Git Operations:**
    *   View changed files.
    *   View diffs for individual files.
    *   Revert changes for selected files.
*   **Secure API Key Storage:** Uses VS Code's secure SecretStorage for API keys.
*   **Settings UI:** Easily configure providers, API keys, and LLM parameters within the extension view.
*   **Detailed Logging:** Provides an "LLM Committer" Output Channel for verbose logging and troubleshooting.

## Requirements

*   **Git:** Must be installed and initialized in your project.
*   **API Key:** An API key for your chosen LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini, or OpenRouter).

## Getting Started

1.  **Install the Extension:** Search for "LLM-Committer" in the VS Code Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`) and click Install.
2.  **Open the LLM Committer View:** Click the LLM Committer icon (typically a robot icon: $(robot)) in the Activity Bar.
3.  **Configure Settings:**
    *   Click the gear icon $(gear) at the top of the LLM Committer view or use the command palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`) and search for "LLM Committer: Settings".
    *   **Select AI Provider:** Choose your preferred LLM provider (e.g., OpenAI).
    *   **Enter API Key:** Enter your API key for the selected provider and click "Save".
    *   **Configure Model (Optional):** Select a model, adjust max tokens, and temperature as needed. Click "Save Model Settings".
    *   **Custom Instructions (Optional):** Add custom instructions for the LLM. Click "Save Instructions".
    *   Click "Test Connection" to ensure your API key and settings are working.

## Usage Workflow

1.  **Make Changes:** Modify files in your Git repository.
2.  **Open LLM Committer:** Access the extension via the Activity Bar.
3.  **Refresh (Optional):** Click the refresh icon $(refresh) if changes aren't appearing. Changes are also refreshed on file save.
4.  **Add General Context (Optional):** If you have overarching context for your current work session (e.g., ticket number, feature name), add it to the "General Context" text area. This is saved per workspace.
5.  **Select Files for Grouping:**
    *   In the "Available Changes" list, check the boxes next to the files you want to include in a single commit.
    *   Click "Create Group (X)" where X is the number of selected files.
6.  **In the Group View:**
    *   Review the files in the group.
    *   **Add Group Specific Context (Optional):** Provide context specific to only this group of changes.
    *   **Generate Commit Message:** Click "ðŸ¤– Generate Message". The LLM will analyze the diffs and context to suggest a message.
    *   **Edit or Regenerate:** Modify the generated message or click "ðŸ¤– Generate Message" again for a new suggestion.
    *   Click "Stage Group".
7.  **Review Staged Groups:**
    *   The group now appears under "Staged Groups".
    *   You can "Edit" a staged group (to change its files, context, or message) or "Unstage" it.
8.  **Commit:**
    *   Once you have one or more staged groups, click "Commit All Staged Groups".
    *   The extension will stage the files for each group and commit them sequentially.
    *   Progress and results will be shown as VS Code notifications and detailed logs in the "LLM Committer" Output Channel.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings (accessible via VS Code Settings UI or `settings.json`):

*   `llmCommitter.llmProvider`: (string, default: `"openai"`)
    *   Description: AI provider to use for generating commit messages.
    *   Enum: `"openai"`, `"anthropic"`, `"gemini"`, `"openrouter"`
*   `llmCommitter.llmInstructions`: (string, default: `""`)
    *   Description: Custom instructions for the LLM when generating commit messages. Leave empty to use default instructions (focused on conventional commits).
*   `llmCommitter.llmModel`: (string, default: `"gpt-4o-mini"` or provider-specific default)
    *   Description: Model to use for generating commit messages. Available models depend on the selected provider.
*   `llmCommitter.maxTokens`: (number, default: `4000`)
    *   Description: Maximum number of tokens to use for the entire LLM request (prompt + completion).
    *   Minimum: `1000`, Maximum: `8000`

*   Example: "Performance may vary for very large diffs or a high number of changed files."
